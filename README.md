# Building Git - Progress Up to Chapter 24

This repository contains my implementation of Git's core functionality based on the book ["Building Git" by James Coglan](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/). 

## Current Progress

I've completed the implementation up to Chapter 24 of the book, which covers:

## How to Build and Run

**Commands**:
   The main executable is `bin/jit`. You can run commands like:
   ```bash
   jit.sh init
   jit.sh add <file>
   jit.sh commit -m "message"
   jit.sh branch
   ```

## Limitations

Since this only goes up to Chapter 24, several Git features are not yet implemented, related to remote operations (fetch/push/pull).

## Acknowledgements

All credit for the project structure and concepts goes to James Coglan's excellent book ["Building Git"](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/). This is purely a learning exercise.
